# ajy-vue-parcel-template

A very much work-in-progress starting point for a Vue app using Parcel.

* <https://vuejs.org/>
* <https://parceljs.org/>

It includes eslint, node-sass, and the Vue router. It also includes husky, with a pre-commit script
to run prettier.

## Get it

Clone this repo, switch to the directory and run:

```
npm install
```

Develop by running this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

## Next

Over time I'm hoping to work further with this to probably make it better, but who knows.

This is currently mainly for my use but if you want to use it or tell me what I did wrong, that'd be much appreciated. Thanks!
